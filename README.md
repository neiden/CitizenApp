## Project assignment:

Citizen aims to resolve communication issues between individuals and local officials/resources; aiming to promote a more seamless dialogue about local issues where citizens have an amplified voice. A new network of crowdsourced information gives local officials, departments, and agencies the vigilance to react adeptly to situations that often go unreported due to lack of insight on certain issues. We believe in the unity of people, programs, and delegates by providing easy access to three way communication and accountability on all parties to improve the surrounding community.
